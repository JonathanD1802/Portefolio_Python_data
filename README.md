# First Beginner Project

Hello everyone, welcome to my new beginner project. 
This project have been made during a codecademy course. 
Consequently, as it's my first Data science project, it need a review. Therefore, don't have any hesitations to provide me with feedbacks ! 

## What's is the aim of this project ? 
For this project I picked up the cvs file you can find within the folder. 
My goal was to analyze the dataset seeking for the best laptops that was purchased in 2024. 
That allowed me to explore the basics Pandas command to clean up, filter and drop the dataframe to optimize the informations I was looking for. 

to conclude, 
Please, if you want to help me enhance my python and data science skills, provide me with feedbacks. 
I'll do my best to improve this project throughout the time.
